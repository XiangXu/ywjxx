## Abstraction

Abstraction means using simple things to represent complexity. We all know how to turn the TV on, but we don't need to konw how it works in order to enjoy it. In Java, abstraciton means simple things like objects, classes and variables represent more complex underlying code and data. This is important because it lets us avoid repeating the same work multiple times. 

## Encapsulation 

This is the practice of keeping fields within a class private, then providing access to them via public methods. It's a protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself. This way, we can re-use object like code components or variables without allowing open access to the data system side.

## Inheritance

This is a special feature of Object Oriented Programming in Java. It lets programmers create new classes that share some of attribute of existing class. This lets us build on previous without reinventing the wheel.

## Polymorphism

This Java OOP concept allows programmers use the same word mean different things in different context. Best two examples here are method overloading and method overriding.
