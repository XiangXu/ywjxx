## Problem 

Given a string s consists of some words separated by spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. If the last word does not exist, return 0.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

```
Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5

Example 2:

Input: s = " "
Output: 0
```

<!-- Line breaks -->
<br />

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.

## Solution

This problem is easy enough. We only need to take care few special cases and then use Java buil-in function. 

```java
class Solution 
{
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) 
    {
        if(s == null || s.length() == 0 || "".equals(s.trim()))
            return 0;
        
        
        String[] splited = s.split("\\s+");
        
        return splited[splited.length - 1].length();
    }
}
```
