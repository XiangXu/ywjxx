## Problem

Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

```
Example 1:

Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1

Example 3:

Input: haystack = "", needle = ""
Output: 0
```

Constraints:

* 0 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 5 * 104
* haystack and needle consist of only lower-case English characters.

## Solution

This problem can be solved by using **substring** method. Basically we can iterator over each character from the given String haystack and get the substring based on the length of String needle. Then check if the sub string equals to needle or not.

```java
class Solution 
{
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) 
    {      
        if(needle == null || needle.length() == 0)
            return 0;
        
        for(int i=0; i<=haystack.length()-needle.length(); i++)
        {
            if(haystack.substring(i, i+needle.length()).equals(needle))
                return i;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Time & Space Complexity:

* **Time Complexity: O(n)**: where n is the length of String haystack.
* **Space Complexity: O(l)**: we only declare some variables.
