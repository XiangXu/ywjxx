## What is a server composed of?

* Compute: CPU
* Memory: RAM
* Storage: Data
* Database: Store data in a structural way 
* Network: Router, Switch, DNS Server

* **Network**: Cables, routers and servers connected with each other.
* **Router**: A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where to send you packets on the Internet.
* **Switch**: Takes a packet and send it to the correct server client on your network.

## What is cloud computing?

* Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery** of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources.
* Through a cloud services platform with **pay as you go** pricing.
* You can **provision exactly the right type and size of computing** resources you need.
* You can access as many resources as you need, **almost instantly**.
* Simple way to access **servers, storage, databases** and set of **application services**.

## The Deployment Models of the Cloud

### Private Cloud

* Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
* Complete control.
* Security for sensitive applications.
* Meet specific business needs.

### Public Cloud

* Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the Internet.
* Six Advantages of Cloud Computing.

### Hybrid Cloud:

* Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud.
* Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure.
* Flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud.


## Types of Cloud Computing

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - Amazone EC2

* Provide building blocks for cloud IT.
* Provide networking, computers, data storage space.
* Highest level of flexibility.

### Differences between each Service

* On-Premises: Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Services, Storage, Networking.
* IaaS: Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, O/S, **Virtualization**, **Services**, **Storage**, **Networking**.
* PaaS: Applications, Data, **Runtime**, **Middleware**, **O/S**, **Virtualization**, **Services**, **Storage**, **Networking**.
* SaaS: **Applications**, **Data**, **Runtime**, **Middleware**, **O/S**, **Virtualization**, **Services**, **Storage**, **Networking**.

## Pricing of the Cloud

* AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals, following the pay-as-you-go pricing model.
* Compute: **pay for compute time**.
* Storage: **Pay for data stored in the cloud**.
* Data transer OUT of the Cloud: **Data transfer IN is free**.

## AWS Availability Zones

* Each region has many availability zones.
* Each availability zone is one or more discrete data centers with redudant power, networking, and connectivity.
